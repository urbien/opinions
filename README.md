## Free speach for apps
We just saw [Parler app being suspended or banned](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/apple-google-parler.html) from app stores by Apple and Google, and by Amazon AWS, 
for the user-produced content inciting violence. 

Putting aside the legal right of these platforms for such banning, 
we need the examine what choke points exist on the Internet today that can be used against the app, w
hatever the intention could be, whether it is social issues, religious, political, anti-competitive, government imposed censorship, or any other.

## Choke points
Please help me identify them, but here are those that I know of:

1. App Stores. App Stores are notorious for blocking apps, 
and Apple has come under the scrutiny of the regulators in 2020 for doing that.
1. Cloud providers. 
1. Domain registrars. 
1. DNS servers infrastructure.  
1. Payment providers. Wikileaks was denied banking services and the only way it was able to survive was the Bitcoin. 
In January 2021, DLive was pressured by Tipalti, a payment company that helps it operate. 
Tilpati said in a statement that it had suspended its service until DLive removed the accounts that had broadcast the Capitol riots.
1. Search engine. If you app can't found on the Internet, it will have to rely on the word-of-mouth only.
1. Ad networks. Similar to search engine. If app can't advertise, its distribution will be limited.
1. CDNs. Content Delivery Networks are often used to speed up downloading of content by users. 
Unfortunately CDN industry is quite concentrated in the handful of hands, like Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, etc. 
CDNs are not unavoidable, but not using them creates a worse customer experience.
1. ISPs. This is the last line of attack, efficiently used today by the states that impose censorship. 
China instituted the first whole-country filtering service, that examines and blocks sites and content. 
A number of other countries followed. Usually VPN can effectively overcome this problem, but in China, 
VPN apps were ordered to be removed from the app stores, and the VPN servers are actively monitored, 
blocked or drastically slowed down by ISPs.

## Attack angles
Although not choke points, the attacks can be executed in different ways. 
1. Denial of Service attacks flooding app's systems can be fairly easily orchestrated.
1. The state can add a company producing the app to the grey / black lists, 
which would require anyone dealing with it to get a special permission from the government. 
This was used by Trump administration against Huawei, ZTE, and many others.
1. Suppliers and customers can be subverted, or influenced in some way or another. 
This is the method Trump administration used by forcing Google to deny Android license to Huawei. 
1. Offices can be raided and servers confiscated.
1. Prosecution.
1. ??? anything I missed?
